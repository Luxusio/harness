## Overview

harness is a goal-oriented control plane for repo-mutating agent work. Users
state work as a native Goal. Harness hooks and MCP tools sync that Goal into a
harness Goal, then create child tasks only as needed. Small requests may stay as
one child task; broad requests may grow additional child tasks as bugs, pages,
domains, or follow-up gaps are discovered.

The design goal is simple runtime behavior:

- one public Goal owns the user request
- child tasks hold scoped implementation work
- task-local planning is written through `write_plan`
- verification is receipt-backed through hook-observed subagent starts
- durable knowledge lands in committed docs, skills, patterns, scripts, or tests

## Goal Flow

```text
native Goal -> harness Goal -> child task(s) -> verify -> close task -> next task or finish Goal
```

The Goal is not a skill. Hooks inject the synchronization instruction and MCP
tools maintain the harness Goal/task queue. The agent chooses whether the Goal
needs another child task by inspecting the current task result, discovered gaps,
and pending user feedback.

## Task Loop

Every repo-mutating child task follows this loop:

```text
plan when needed -> minimum-sufficient develop -> independent review -> runtime QA -> verify -> close
```

No verification is skipped. If verification finds a gap, the task returns to
develop or creates a follow-up child task when the gap is separable.

## Protected Artifacts

| Artifact | Writer |
|---|---|
| `PLAN.md`, `PLAN.meta.json`, optional `CHECKS.yaml`, optional `AUDIT_TRAIL.md` | MCP `write_plan` |
| `CHECKS.yaml` status transitions after plan | `plugin/scripts/update_checks.py` |
| `SUBAGENT_RECEIPTS.jsonl` | Codex/Claude subagent lifecycle hooks, including the root-hook-registered, MCP-hosted Codex watcher |
| `REVIEW_RECEIPTS.jsonl` | Codex/Claude reviewer lifecycle hooks, including the root-hook-registered, MCP-hosted Codex watcher |
| `CONVERSATION.md` | Codex/Claude UserPromptSubmit/Subagent hooks |
| durable docs under `doc/<area>/<TYPE>__*.md` | normal committed doc edits or `plugin/scripts/req_scaffold.py` |

Manual evidence writers are intentionally absent. The MCP server does not expose
manual evidence writers, critic writers, handoff writers, or REQ writer tools.
`CONVERSATION.md` is readable task history; machine enforcement only reads
explicit `<!-- item: ... -->` markers.

## Verification

Verification has two responsibilities:

- operation check: the changed system works as implemented
- intent adequacy check: the result satisfies the user's request and durable
  requirements

A source-changing task first requires the always-on read-only code reviewer and,
when path or diff-content signals identify a security-sensitive boundary, the
read-only security reviewer. Their hook-owned `REVIEW_RECEIPTS.jsonl`
completions must explicitly PASS the current HEAD and uncommitted worktree
fingerprint. Docs-only/non-code tasks receive an explicit routing exemption.

Only QA started after the latest review PASS is eligible for runtime PASS. Every
applicable QA lens then needs a hook-owned `SUBAGENT_RECEIPTS.jsonl` completion
with explicit `VERDICT: PASS`. A start receipt proves delegation only. FAIL,
BLOCKED_ENV, missing verdicts, missing lenses, unmatched lifecycle events, and
source edits after review or QA prevent close. Self-authored PASS notes,
summaries, or narrative evidence do not close the task. Commands and inline
checks may still help debugging, but close authority comes from `task_verify`
reading task state and the two lifecycle streams.

Codex runtimes do not always forward collaboration tools to plugin
`PostToolUse`. SessionStart and each installed Codex root hook therefore validate
the current official `session_id` (with a matching environment fallback),
canonical repository, root rollout, and initial offset, then writes a versioned
registration under the current user's state directory. Registration retries
briefly on SessionStart when rollout creation races hook delivery. Later hooks
restore missing or invalid registration state without overwriting a valid
initial offset; late recovery begins at the current offset and covers only
future subagent starts. An existing version-3 registration is validated from its
exact state and rollout paths before discovery, so ordinary hook events do not
recursively scan the session tree, acquire the registration lock, or rewrite
state. Discovery for a missing registration is deadline-aware and registration
locking is non-blocking. PreToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, and PostToolUse wrappers
enforce one total child-work deadline strictly below their configured outer
Codex hook timeout; individual subprocesses consume the remaining shared budget.
It does not fork. The existing Harness MCP server discovers these registrations
and hosts one passive daemon watcher thread per root tuple. MCP restart replays
from the immutable initial offset; receipt deduplication makes replay safe.
Because Codex MCP processes do not receive the root thread id as process state,
the watcher binds a root to a task only from that root rollout's successful
Harness `task_start` or `task_context` completion event, after canonical task
state validation and before the reviewed or QA child starts.

Each rollout is opened with no-follow semantics and validated by descriptor
identity, owner, link count, non-group/world-writable mode, size, and an owner-controlled non-writable session
directory chain. Path replacement or inode changes fail closed. A
per-registration interprocess lease ensures that concurrent MCP servers cannot
tail and append evidence for the same root tuple at the same time.

The watcher captures HEAD and the task diff fingerprint only while a correlated
child is still running, then accepts completion only when the root-delivered
message matches the child rollout's final answer and task-complete record.
Historical finals, unrecognized lenses, cross-repository lineage, partial
records, symlinks, unsafe registrations, and schema ambiguity cannot create
PASS. The unresolved repository `doc/harness/tasks` directory chain is also
owner/type checked with `lstat`; symlinked task roots cannot redirect receipts
across repositories. No model-callable MCP tool can author review or QA evidence. The
MCP-hosted watcher and classic PostToolUse path share the same protected receipt
owner and freshness gates. No recovery hook converts a child that completed
before start capture into evidence.

## Durable Knowledge

Task-local files are not shared memory. User-stated durable requirements,
observable behavior contracts, significant decisions, reusable implementation
guidance, and surprising reusable discoveries must be promoted to committed
surfaces:

- `REQ__*.md` for observable behavior and contracts
- `GUIDE__*.md` for reusable guidance
- `ADR__*.md` for significant technical choices
- `POLICY__*.md` for external constraints
- skills, patterns, scripts, or tests when those are the right executable
  knowledge surface

`doc/harness/learnings.jsonl` is staging only. It helps identify promotion
candidates but does not satisfy the durable-memory requirement by itself.

## Runtime Boundaries

harness does not require users to choose between run/autopilot modes. A Goal may
remain small or expand child tasks dynamically. Hooks provide compact context
and record subagent starts; MCP tools own explicit state transitions.
